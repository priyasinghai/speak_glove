# speak_glove
The project involves the development of a wearable sensor-based glove capable of translating sign language gestures into English text, integrated with a mobile application that displays the real-time translation.

#Objectives
-Captures hand gestures using flex sensors embedded in a wearable glove.
-Process and classify gestures using flex sensors using nRF5280.
-Transmit recognized gestures wirelessly to a mobile application.
-Provide haptic feedback to confirm gesture recognition.

#Features
-Real-time Sign language translation
-Wireless glove-to-app communication
-Simple and intuitive mobile interface
-Wearable and portable Design 

#Future Improvements
-Support for continuous and dynamic gestures
-Multi-language support

This project was developed collaboratively, with team members contributing to:
-Hardware design and sensor integration
-Embedded programming and gesture logic
-Mobile application development
-Testing, calibration and documentation
