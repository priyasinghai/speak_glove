# 4-Layer PCB – Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense Version

This folder contains the PCB layout, Gerber files, and design assets for the
4-layer wearable version of the Sign Language Translation Glove using the
Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense module.

## 🔹 Key Features
- 4-layer PCB for improved signal integrity and compact routing
- Designed around the **XIAO nRF52840 Sense** (with built-in IMU/accelerometer)
- Optimized for low power consumption and wearable use
- Supports flex sensors and IMU inputs with clean analog routing
- Includes proper ground plane separation for noise reduction

## 🔹 Files Included
- `pcb_layout.pdf` – Readable PCB layout
- `pcb_source.json` – Editable EasyEDA project file
- `gerber/` – Manufacturing files
- `photos/` – PCB renders and real images

## 🔹 Purpose
This PCB represents the final, production-ready hardware for the glove, replacing
the ESP32 prototype with a smaller, more efficient, and sensor-integrated design.
