## 🔹 Purpose of This Version

This ESP32 version was used for early development and prototyping.  
It allowed rapid testing of:

- Flex sensor interfacing  
- MPU6050 motion sensing  
- Signal processing  
- Wireless communication  
- Data transmission to PC/mobile  
- Firmware debugging  

This design served as the foundation for the later **nRF-based wearable version**, which is more optimized for low power and compact size.
